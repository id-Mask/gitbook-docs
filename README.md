# 🦰 What is id-Mask?



**idMask** is an app that allows users to prove statements about themselves and do not share any personal information except for the proof. Users can link their proofs to their blockchain address (optional).

Produced proofs can be utilized by other parties that find it useful, for example other apps, governments, DEX'es and what not. For more check [How to consume proofs?](for-developers/how-to-consume-proofs.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently only people from the Baltic states can produce proofs. Personal identification data is streamlined using [Smart-ID](https://www.smart-id.com/) app.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
📢 We're on the lookout for apps in other parts of the world that can help us provide the same functionality. If you know apps other than Smart-ID that can help properly streamline personal identification data from citizens in other countries, please reach out.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
