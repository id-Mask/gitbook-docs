# 🦰 What is id-Mask?



**idMask** is an app that allows users to prove statements about themselves and do not share any personal information except for the proof. Users can link their proofs to their blockchain address (optional).

Produced proofs can be utilized by other parties that find it useful, for example other apps, governments, DEX'es and what not. For more check [How to consume proofs?](for-developers/how-to-consume-proofs.md)

***

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently only people from the Baltic states can produce proofs. Personal identification data is streamlined using [Smart-ID](https://www.smart-id.com/) app.
{% endhint %}

## How can I use it?

Visit the app and follow to instructions to create proofs. Currently, users are able to create three proofs:

1. 🏛️ Proof of non-sanctions
2. 👴 Proof of adulthood
3. 🧠 Proof of unique human
